 Time-Series Analysis: tracked sales trends over distinct fiscal periods.
 Geographic & Category Drilling: Users can filter data by Region, Customer Type (New vs. Returning), and Product Category.
 Interactive Filters: A fully responsive control panel allowing for "slice-and-dice" analysis of the dataset.

 🛠️ Technical Workflow
1.  Data Ingestion: Connected a Kaggle Sales Dataset via Google Sheets.
2.  Data Transformation: Cleaned data types and established date-range dimensions.
3.  Visualization: Built a "Free Form" layout in Looker Studio, prioritizing UI/UX principles (alignment, whitespace, and color hierarchy) to make the data digestible.
